## Prerequisites

Before installing the Metabase Pinot Driver, ensure you have the following:

- **Git**
- **Docker**
- **Java 17**
- **Clojure 1.12.1.1550**
- **NodeJS 22**
- **NPM 10**
- **Yarn 1.22**
- A running **Apache Pinot 1.3.0** instance
- **Metabase v0.55.7**

## Install from Release

The easiest way to install the driver is to download a pre-built JAR from the [Releases page](https://github.com/startreedata/metabase-pinot-driver/releases).

1. Download the latest `pinot.metabase-driver-v{version}.jar` from the releases page
2. Place the JAR file in your Metabase `plugins/` directory
3. Restart Metabase
4. The **Pinot** driver will now be available when adding a new database connection

{: .note }
If your Metabase `plugins/` directory doesn't exist, create it in the same directory as your Metabase JAR file.

## Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/startreedata/metabase-pinot-driver.git
   cd metabase-pinot-driver
   ```

2. Build the driver:

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

   This builds both Metabase and the Pinot driver.

3. To build only the driver (if you already have Metabase):

   ```bash
   make driver
   ```

4. Start Metabase with the Pinot driver:

   ```bash
   make server
   ```

## Verify Installation

After starting Metabase:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Databases** > **Add a database**
2. Look for **Pinot** in the database type dropdown
3. If it appears, the driver is installed correctly
